            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            Stress is an escalated psycho-physiological state of the human body emerging in response to a
            challenging event or a demanding condition. Environmental factors that trigger stress are called stressors.
            In case of prolonged exposure to multiple stressors impacting simultaneously, a person’s mental and
            physical health can be adversely affected which can further lead to chronic health issues. To prevent
            stress-related issues, it is necessary to detect them in the nascent stages which are possible only by
            continuous monitoring of stress. Wearable devices promise real-time and continuous data collection,
            which helps in personal stress monitoring. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been presented,
            which focuses on stress detection using wearable sensors and applied machine learning techniques. This
            paper investigates the stress detection approaches adopted in accordance with the sensory devices such
            as wearable sensors, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and also depending on
            various environments like during driving, studying, and working. The stressors, techniques, results,
            advantages, limitations, and issues for each study are highlighted and expected to provide a path for
            future research studies. Also, a multimodal stress detection system using a wearable sensor-based deep
            learning technique has been proposed at the end.
            Stress is the reaction of a human body marked by great anxiety or duress when faced with a
            challenging condition. The clinical definition of stress can be a psycho-physiological state of extreme
            discomfort and distress for an individual that can get extrapolated to acute mental health problems like
            depression or anxiety attacks. A stressor is an event or condition present in or around an individual which
            may tend to trigger stress. The impact of stress on an individual can be positive and negative (also called
            as good and bad respectively) depending on the way stressful situations are handled. This means that
            whereas a situation can be extremely stressful for one individual it may happen to be just a mild reaction
            for another. Moreover, a prior stressful experience provides a defensive mechanism in repeated
            conditions. For people who like to lead a life full of challenges, stress acts as an adrenalin booster. Hence
            they consider stress as an affirmative reaction. Stress which has a positive impact is called Eustress. It is
            a type of stress an individual feels when some stimulating incident is expected to happen in their
            surrounding environment. It is marked by an increase in pulse rate but without any underlying feeling of
            threat or fear.</p>

            <h2>chapter 2</h2>
            <p>Eustress can reinforce people’s mental ability to meet daily challenges and motivate them to
                achieve their goals and complete tasks more efficiently. Eustress pushes people to come out of their
                comfort zone which in turn inspires them to learn, grow and become stronger. Stress which has a negative
                impact called distress is marked by anxiety or a high level of concern. It can be a short-term or long-term
                occurrence. The effects of distress can be manifested as a decrease in performance and a lack of mental
                clarity. Chronic or major diseases can also cause distress which may prove extremely difficult for the
                human brain and the body to handle, possibly even leading to depression and other mental and physical
                health issues. External environments like work and internal stimulations like feelings and habitual
                behavior can also cause distress. Some common sources of distress include fear, worrying about future
                events, recurring negative thoughts, unrealistic and perfectionist expectations, over-scheduling, improper
                future planning, excessive job demands, job insecurity, failing to be assertive, etc. Some personal
                stressors can also cause bad stress like the death of a family member, illness or injury, money problems,
                unemployment, sleep problems, legal problems, etc. Hence it is important to detect duress as early as
                possible as it can have a serious impact on people’s lives.
                . Stress is also known as the ‘‘fight-or-flight’’
                response as it evolves as a survival mechanism, enabling people to react speedily to life-threatening or
                challenging situations. An individual’s body activates resources for self-protection when met with a
                threat or challenge. These resources either help face the situation or provide an expedited escape route.
                This fight-or-flight response is the reaction of the body’s sympathetic nervous system that reacts to a
                stressor by producing larger quantities of chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline [1]. This
                increases the heartbeat, tightens the muscles, increases blood pressure, causes breathlessness, and
                sharpens the senses. This in turn protects the individual in dangerous and challenging situations by
                increasing his strength, stamina, focus and enabling faster reaction time, resulting in an expedited
                decision making about whether to fight or flee from the impending danger. A list of nomenclature used
                in this review paper is enumerated in table 1 as follows. This review paper investigates the following
                significant aspects of mental stress detection-
                • Those stress detection methods are discussed where wearable devices for data collection and
                machine learning techniques for determining stress levels were used
                . • Various commercial devices used for physiological data signal collection are listed.</p>

                <p>1.1 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS OVERLOAD:
                    People easily adapt to stress as it starts to feel adjustable and mitigable in due time. They fail to
                    observe the ill effects of the prolonged exposure to even low levels of stress affecting them and causing
                    damage to their health. Hence it is pertinent to be aware of the common warning signs and symptoms of
                    stress overload. Table 2 lists the signs and symptoms of stress overload. Overload of stress can lead to
                    major depression in susceptible people. Generally, chronic stressful life situations can increase the risk
                    of developing depression. Various machine learning techniques play an important role in the
                    identification of depression which is described.

                    In case of prolonged exposure to multiple stressors impacting simultaneously, a person’s mental and

                    <p>1.2 EXISTING METHOD
                        There are some surveys available in this area of automatic stress detection. the authors studied
                        some physiological parameters and concluded that the best among them was the one that was influenced
                        by pressure and proposed an appropriate framework to use in stress recognition. They also summarized
                        techniques to analyze and recognize stress by using various wearable sensors. According to this review,
                        the detection of stress is more accurate when HR, temperature, humidity, blood pressure, and vocal tone
                        are used together. But since the review was done considering limited papers only, the resulted research
                        outcomes were considered inadequate due to a lack of comprehensive study
                        Disadvantages:
                        The present method undergoes a lot of medical practises. Patients have to cooperate with the doctors.
                        There are some opportunities that the result might go unpredictable because of manual calculations.
                        1.3 PROPOSED SYSTEM
                        This paper investigates the stress detection approaches adopted in accordance with the sensory
                        devices such as wearable sensors, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and also
                        depending on various environments like during driving, studying, and working. The stressors,
                        techniques, results, advantages, limitations, and issues for each study are highlighted and expected to
                        provide a path for future research studies. Also, a multimodal stress detection system using a wearable
                        sensor-based deep learning technique has been proposed at the end.</p>

                        <p>This system can be embedded in security systems to improve the overall security of access
                            control as it provides 99.5% accuracy in stress detection. Firefighters and smoke divers are
                            constantly exposed to stressful situations as they engaged in rescue activities involving fire and
                            poisonous smoke. Any stress in such situations may occur mainly due to lack of knowledge about
                            the affected place, fast-changing conditions, time restrictions, exhaustion, disturbing sights,
                            elevated level of heat, or smoke. This exposure to high-risk environments while performing their
                            jobs, leads to various mental and health problems due to constant physical and psychological
                            stress. Hence some researchers have used wearable devices to monitor and detect stress to
                            improve the health and work safety of such personnel. U. Plunkte , developed a model to detect
                            and classify physical and mental stress in real-time using HRV data collected with a wearable
                            chest strap sensor in laboratory conditions. The classifier C5 decision tree was found to be better
                            than Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 88% accuracy and precision, recall, and F-score close
                            to 90%. The F-score calculated for this model was 0.88 with C5. This model was applied to 7
                            firefighters during a training exercise at a rescue Maze.
                            1.8 REAL-TIME STRESS MONITORING
                            Data collection is an important and crucial step in all types of research. The majority of
                            studies in the literature reported on short-term physiological changes in a controlled laboratory
                            environment which included physical tests and questionnaires that relied generally on userentered data which can be subjective and inaccurate. The hormonal techniques and subjective
                            questionnaires are not suitable for real-time monitoring of stress levels and also require people
                            to get out of their daily routine activities . For the validation of results, it is necessary to
                            measure physiological parameters for an extended time in real-time conditions which can be a
                            real challenge. The recorded signals can be influenced by various context facts like a poster,
                            temperature, and physical activity, and various types of artifacts like motion artifacts.
                            Stress is a growing problem for people in offices due to issues related to their jobs and heavy
                            workloads. Hence it is important to monitor and control the employee’s stress levels on a regular
                            scale to detect stress in early stages and prevent any harmful impacts on health.</p>
